John woke up in the dark. He groped around and felt an object. There was a
switch on it, “tick, pang!” in the voiceless dark, he turned on that switch.
That was an old style flashlight, then first flash into John’s eye was a huge
portrait of a man’s terrified face. John jumped and laid down on the ground. 
Shocked for a while, he felt he was sat on something warm…

"What could I possibly be sitting on?", John thought to himself.
He got up and aimed the flashlight onto the object was sitting on.
It happened to be some sort of heating vent, but looking down into it,
John saw movement inside the vent. Almost as if something was crawling up 
the vent...

He heard a rustle and then saw a small creature coming out out of the vent. 
The animal was furry and nothing like John had seen before. The small creature
looked like a mix between a chinchilla and a small tiger. The furry creature
was kind of cute. John crouched down to pet the creature. All of a sudden, 
John heard a scream.

He began to walk towards the noise. The path waas dark. He felt as though someone was watching him.Everytime he looked around his surrounding seemed to have moved. His heart began to beat fast.

The little animal rushes to John when his heart rate peaks and bited his throat.
John dead with a terrified face. Many other same animals came and teared up 
John's body excepect his face. Finally, the one which killed John wore John's 
head and jumped into one of the empty frame in the cave.
