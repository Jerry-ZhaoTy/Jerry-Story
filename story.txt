John woke up in the dark. He groped around and felt an object. There was a
switch on it, “tick, pang!” in the voiceless dark, he turned on that switch.
That was an old style flashlight, then first flash into John’s eye was a huge
portrait of a man’s terrified face. John jumped and laid down on the ground. 
Shocked for a while, he felt he was sat on something warm…

"What could I possibly be sitting on?", John thought to himself.
He got up and aimed the flashlight onto the object was sitting on.
It happened to be some sort of heating vent, but looking down into it,
John saw movement inside the vent. Almost as if something was crawling up 
the vent...
